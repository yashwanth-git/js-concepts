# Call

Invoke a function by passing a object. So if suppose an object does not have a function but the function is available outside the object you can borrow that to the object [instead of copy pasting the function into the object and wasting the memory]

# Apply

Apply is exactly the same as call, but the parameters are passed in array

# Bind

Return a new function with the given function and object. Should call the returned function for it to do the magic
